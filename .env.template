# If you mount xlwings Server on a non-root path (e.g., https://my.domain.com/myapp)

# To authenticate users, provide the Auth providers as list.
# E.g, to enable Entra ID SSO auth: XLWINGS_AUTH_PROVIDERS=["entraid"]. If you want

# A Redis URL for the caching of object handles. Required for production use.

# This setting expects a cron expression that determines when objects that are cached
# via object handles should be purged from the cache. This requires

# If you use Office Scripts as the client (instead of Office.js or VBA)

# This will be prepended to all custom functions, e.g., "XLWINGS.MYFUNC". Note that
