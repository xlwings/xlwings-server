# xlwings Server

## Features

- Only requires Python 3.9+ (no dependency on Node.js or Webpack)
- Uses FastAPI as the web framework
- Comes with htmx (client-server interaction), Alpine.js (CSP build, for client interactions), and Socket.io (for streaming functions and realtime updates of the task pane)
- Comes with Bootstrap-xlwings, a Bootstrap theme in the Excel look
- Runs in an air-gapped environment without access to the Internet or any Microsoft servers
- Supports SSO (Single Sign-On) authentication and RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) via Entra ID (previously known as Azure AD) simply by adding the Client and Tenant IDs to the `.env` file
- The task pane is hot-reloaded with every code change during development
- Tight security: uses the HTTP response headers recommended by OWASP including the most restrictive CSP header
- Supports streaming functions out-of-the-box
- Cache busting for static files is automatically done when using the Docker image
- The manifest is a template that uses the correct URLs and IDs to prevent name clashing with different environments: it is shown under `/manifest`
- Development can be done on GitHub Codespaces, saving you from installing Python or mkcert locally
- Test coverage (growing...)
- xlwings is free for non-commercial use. Commercial users can request access to a private repo from where they can fork it privately to be able to easily pull in updates.

## Dev environment

- Follow the steps under https://docs.xlwings.org/en/latest/pro/server/officejs_addins.html#quickstart (but using this repo instead of the one mentioned in the quickstart). Mainly, you need to install `mkcert` to create local certificates as Office.js requires the web app to be served via https (not http) even on localhost.
- Alternatively, you can run this repo on GitHub Codepaces (make sure to expose the port 8000 publicly)
- Run `python run.py init`: this copies `.env.template` over to `.env` (`.env` isn't tracked in Git) and replaces the default manifest UUIDs under `app/config.py` with your own ones. Make sure to commit `app/config.py` once it has your own UUIDs.
- Advanced configuration is done via `.env` file, where the settings are explained (note that lines starting with `#` are comments)

**Backend via Python directly:**

- Install the dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run the app: `python run.py`

**Backend via Docker**:

- Install Docker and Docker Compose
- To run the dev server: `docker compose up`
- Run `docker compose build` whenever you need to install a new dependency via `requirements.txt`

**Office.js add-in**:

- Has to be sideloaded, see: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/testing/test-debug-office-add-ins#sideload-an-office-add-in-for-testing
- You'll find the addin by going to the `/manifest` endpoint, e.g., on localhost, go to https://127.0.0.1:8000/manifest. Store the text in a file called `manifest.xml` that you can use to sideload the add-in.

## Scripts & custom functions

- Custom functions can be added under `app/custom_functions/examples.py`. To add your own Python modules, see the instructions at the top of `examples.py`. There is a sample custom function included that can be run via `=XLWINGS.HELLO("xlwings")`. There's also a streaming function (`=XLWINGS.STREAMING_RANDOM(2, 3)`). The `XLWINGS` prefix ("namespace") can be adjusted via the settings (`XLWINGS_FUNCTIONS_NAMESPACE` in `.env` file). Except for the prod environment, `-dev` and `-uat` are automatically appended to avoid name clashes. So if you run this under a dev environment, you'll find the custom functions under the `XLWINGS_DEV` prefix.

- Scripts can be added under `app/custom_scripts/examples.py`. To add your own Python modules, see the instructions at the top of `examples.py`. They will need to be bound to a button on either the ribbon (via `app/templates/manifest.xml`) or task pane (e.g., see `app/templates/examples/hello_world/taskpane_hello.html`). There is a sample button `Hello World` included on both the ribbon and task pane. On the task pane, connecting a button is as easy as adding the `xw-click` attribute with the name of the Python function. Optionally, you can add configuration via `xw-config`, however the `auth` config is handled automatically:

  ```html
  <button
    xw-click="hello_world"
    xw-config='{"include": "Sheet1"}'
    class="btn btn-primary btn-sm"
    type="button">
    Hello World
  </button>
  ```

  If you want to call scripts from VBA, Office Scripts, or Google Apps Script, you will need to use the runPython function with the following endpoint:

  ```vb
  runPython("https://127.0.0.1:8000/xlwings/custom-scripts-call/hello_world")
  ```

## Prod deployment

- **Note that the web app _has_ to be served via https, not http!**
- **The app could be deployed directly via Dockerfile using a service such as Render.com, Heroku, etc. and only requires the XLWINGS_LICENSE_KEY environment variable to be set.**

**Backend via Python directly:**

- Set the environment variable: `XLWINGS_LICENSE_KEY=...`
- Install the dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run the app: `gunicorn app.main:main_app --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 --access-logfile - --workers 1 --worker-class uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker`

**Backend via Docker**:

- Install Docker and Docker Compose
- Copy `.env.template` to `.env` and update `XLWINGS_LICENSE_KEY=...`
- `docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yaml build`
- `docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yaml up -d`

**Frontend via Office.js add-in:**

- You will get the manifest content under your `URL/manifest`. For example, if you run this on localhost, you can go to https://127.0.0.1:8000/manifest. Copy the content into a file called `manifest.xml`.
- If the manifest doesn't show the correct URL, set the `XLWINGS_HOSTNAME` settings in `.env` to the domain where your backend runs, e.g., `XLWINGS_HOSTNAME=xlwings.mycompany.com`.
- The `manifest.xml` has to be deployed via the Office admin console, see: https://docs.xlwings.org/en/latest/pro/server/officejs_addins.html#production-deployment. The Office admin console also allows you to point directly to the `/manifest` endpoint.

**Installing deploy keys automatically in Docker images**

If you have your developer license key set as `XLWINGS_DEVELOPER_KEY` env var in your build environment, it will install the deploy key directly in the Docker image when running `docker build --build-arg XLWINGS_DEVELOPER_KEY=${XLWINGS_DEVELOPER_KEY} .`. This will happen automatically when running `docker compose build`.

## Authentication & Authorization with Entra ID (previously called Azure AD)

1. Register your Excel add-in as app on Microsoft Entra ID by following these instructions: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/develop/register-sso-add-in-aad-v2

2. Set your environment variables, e.g., in `.env` like this:

   ```
   XLWINGS_AUTH_PROVIDERS=["entraid"]
   XLWINGS_AUTH_ENTRAID_TENANT_ID="xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
   XLWINGS_AUTH_ENTRAID_CLIENT_ID="xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
   ```

3. Calling custom functions and custom scripts use the `dependencies.User` dependency injection to authenticate the user (see application logs).

4. To only allow users with specific roles to use your application, you can use the `XLWINGS_AUTH_REQUIRED_ROLES` setting.

5. To set up the roles in Entra ID and map them to users, follow these instructions:

   Go to All Services > Microsoft Entra ID > App registrations > Your app > App roles (left sidebar):

   - Click on Create app role
   - Display name (e.g.): Writer
   - Allowed member types: Users/Groups
   - Value (e.g.): Task.Write
   - Description (e.g.): Writer
   - Checkbox must be active for `Do you want to enable this app role`?
   - Apply => Repeat for other roles

   Go all the way back to All Services > Microsoft Entra ID, then under Enterprise applications (left sidebar):

   - Select your app
   - Click on the `Assign users and groups` link in the "1. Assign users and groups" box
   - Click on `+ Add user/group`
     - Under User, click on `None Selected` and select a user or group. Confirm with `Select`.
     - Under Role, click on `None Selected` and select the desired role (if you don't see any role, wait a moment and reload the page). Confirm with `Select`.
     - Repeat the last step to give the user more roles

## Deployment to Azure Functions

NOTE: Azure functions don't support streaming functions.

For the following walk through, you'll need to have the Azure CLI and Azure Functions Core Tools installed, see [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

### Create a function app

While you can run Azure functions locally, we're deploying the function app directly to Azure:

In the commands below, we're going to use the following names/parameters:

- the function app: `xlwings-quickstart`
- the resource group: `xlwings-quickstart-rg`
- the storage account: `xlwingsquickstartsa`
- deploy it to the region: `westeurope`

Note that you may need to use different names/parameters though.

Before you begin, you'll need to login to Azure:

```bash
az login
```

1.  Create a resource group:

    ```bash
    az group create --name xlwings-quickstart-rg --location westeurope
    ```

2.  Create storage account:

    ```bash
    az storage account create --name xlwingsquickstartsa --location westeurope --resource-group xlwings-quickstart-rg --sku Standard_LRS
    ```

3.  Create the function app (if possible, use the same Python version locally as the one specified in this command):

    ```bash
    az functionapp create --resource-group xlwings-quickstart-rg --consumption-plan-location westeurope --runtime python --runtime-version 3.11 --functions-version 4 --name xlwings-quickstart --os-type linux --storage-account xlwingsquickstartsa
    ```

4.  Set the required environment variables (you can get a free trial key [here](https://www.xlwings.org/trial)). Note that streaming functions
    and other Socket.io-related functionality is not supported with Azure Functions:

    ```bash
    az functionapp config appsettings set --name xlwings-quickstart --resource-group xlwings-quickstart-rg --settings XLWINGS_LICENSE_KEY=<YOUR_LICENSE_KEY> XLWINGS_ENVIRONMENT=prod XLWINGS_ENABLE_SOCKETIO=false
    ```

5.  Run the following to enable the worker process to index the functions:

    ```bash
    az functionapp config appsettings set --name xlwings-quickstart --resource-group xlwings-quickstart-rg --settings AzureWebJobsFeatureFlags=EnableWorkerIndexing
    ```

6.  Deploy the function app (this is also the command to run to deploy an update):

    ```bash
    func azure functionapp publish xlwings-quickstart
    ```

    It should terminate with the following message:

    ```bash
    Remote build succeeded!
    [...] Syncing triggers...
    Functions in xlwings-quickstart:
       http_app_func - [httpTrigger]
          Invoke url: https://xlwings-quickstart.azurewebsites.net//{*route}
    ```

8. On Azure portal, under Function App > Your Function App > CORS, set `Allowed Origins` to `*` if you want to be able to call the functions from Excel on the web. This step should not be required if you're only using the desktop version of Excel.

### Cleanup

After running this tutorial you can get rid of all the resources again by running:

```bash
az group delete --name xlwings-quickstart-rg
```
