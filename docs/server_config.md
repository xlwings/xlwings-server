# Server Config

Please refer to the `.env` file, which is thoroughly commented. If you don't have an `.env` file, you will need to run `python run.py init` first or you can look at [`.env.template`](https://github.com/xlwings/xlwings-server/blob/main/.env.template).

Instead of using a `.env` file, you can provide the settings via environment variables or secrets.
