# Azure Functions

## Prerequisites

- Follow [](repo_setup.md) or simply clone the [xlwings Server Repo](https://github.com/xlwings/xlwings-server) if you just want to deploy xlwings Server for a quick test.

Install the following software:

- [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
- [Azure Functions Core Tools](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local)

Before you begin, you'll need to login to Azure:

```text
az login
```

```{note}
If you deploy to Azure Functions using a different method, you should be able to adapt the instructions accordingly.
```

## Files

The following files are part of Azure functions setup and may need to be tweaked:

- `host.json`
- `local.settings.json`
- `function_app.py`
- `.funcignore`

## Deployment

In the commands below, we're going to use the following parameters that you should adjust to match your preferences:

- The function app: `xlwings-server`
- The resource group: `xlwings-server-rg`
- The storage account: `xlwingsserversa`
- Region: `westeurope`

```{important}
You need to replace `xlwings-server` with your own app name in all of the the following commands as the name needs to be globally unique.
```

You may also want to skip some of the steps, e.g., if you already have an existing resource group or storage account to deploy to.

1.  Create a resource group:

    ```text
    az group create --name xlwings-server-rg --location westeurope
    ```

2.  Create storage account:

    ```text
    az storage account create --name xlwingsserversa --location westeurope --resource-group xlwings-server-rg --sku Standard_LRS
    ```

3.  Create the function app (if possible, use the same Python version locally as the one specified in this command):

    ```text
    az functionapp create --resource-group xlwings-server-rg --consumption-plan-location westeurope --runtime python --runtime-version 3.11 --functions-version 4 --name xlwings-server --os-type linux --storage-account xlwingsserversa
    ```

4.  Set the required environment variables. Make sure to provide your own license key at the end of this command (you can get a free trial key [here](https://www.xlwings.org/trial)). You'll also need to adjust the `XLWINGS_ENVIRONMENT` if this is not the `prod` environment:

    ```text
    az functionapp config appsettings set --name xlwings-server --resource-group xlwings-server-rg --settings XLWINGS_ENVIRONMENT=prod XLWINGS_ENABLE_SOCKETIO=false XLWINGS_LICENSE_KEY=<YOUR_LICENSE_KEY>
    ```

5.  Run the following to enable the worker process to index the functions:

    ```text
    az functionapp config appsettings set --name xlwings-server --resource-group xlwings-server-rg --settings AzureWebJobsFeatureFlags=EnableWorkerIndexing
    ```

6.  Deploy the function app (this is also the command to deploy an update):

    ```{important}
    This command must be run from the root of your xlwings-server repo.
    ```

    ```text
    func azure functionapp publish xlwings-server
    ```

    It should terminate with the following message:

    ```text
    Remote build succeeded!
    [...] Syncing triggers...
    Functions in xlwings-server:
       http_app_func - [httpTrigger]
          Invoke url: https://xlwings-server.azurewebsites.net//{*route}
    ```

    If you don't have access to the `func` CLI, e.g., in the Azure cloud shell, use the following commands instead:

    ```{important}
    This command must be run from the root of your xlwings-server repo.
    ```

    ```
    zip -r function.zip .

    az functionapp deployment source config-zip \
    --resource-group xlwings-server-rg \
    --name xlwings-server \
    --src function.zip \
    --build-remote true
    ```

If there's nothing printed after `Functions in ...`, have a look at [](#logging) to find out the reason, otherwise go to the URL without the `//{*route}` part (in the example, that would be `https://xlwings-server.azurewebsites.net`) and you should see `{"status": "ok"}`.

## Logging

- If your app correctly deploys including syncing triggers, you can look at the runtime logs in Azure portal like so:
  `Function App` > `My Function App`. Then, under `http_app_func`, click on `Invocations and more`.

- If your Azure functions doesn't manage to sync triggers, i.e., it doesn't print a URL after running `func azure functionapp publish`, you need to go to the Azure portal:
  `Function App` > `My Function App`. In the left-hand menu, select `Diagnose and solve problems` > `Availability and Performance` and finally click on `Functions that are not triggered` on the left-hand side.

- For a live tail of your functions, go to `Monitoring` > `Log stream` and wait until it says `Connected!`. Now run an xlwings function or script and you should see the logging turning up. Note that this is only for live tailing, you won't see log messages from the past here. You may want to try out both `App Insights Logs` and `Filesystem Logs`.

## Cleanup

After running this tutorial you can get rid of all the resources again by running:d

```text
az group delete --name xlwings-server-rg
```

## Azure DevOps Pipelines

Here's a sample `azure-pipelines.yml` file:

```yaml
trigger:
- main

variables:
  # To set up the service connection:
  # 1. Go to your Azure DevOps project
  # 2. Navigate to Project Settings â†’ Service connections
  # 3. Create a new Azure Resource Manager service connection
  # 4. Give it a name
  # 5. Use that name here under variables
  azureServiceConnection: 'TODO'
  functionAppName: 'TODO'
  resourceGroupName: 'TODO'

pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

steps:
- bash: |
    zip -r function.zip .
  displayName: 'Create deployment package'

- task: AzureCLI@2
  displayName: 'Deploy to Azure Functions'
  inputs:
    azureSubscription: $(azureServiceConnection)
    scriptType: 'bash'
    scriptLocation: 'inlineScript'
    inlineScript: |

      # Deploy with remote build
      az functionapp deployment source config-zip \
        --resource-group $(resourceGroupName) \
        --name $(functionAppName) \
        --src function.zip \
        --build-remote true

```

## Limitations

- Azure functions don't support WebSockets directly, i.e., streaming functions won't work. However, you should be able to use the Azure service "Web PubSub for Socket.IO" instead.
- The function is always called `http_app_func`, see https://github.com/Azure-Samples/fastapi-on-azure-functions/issues/31
