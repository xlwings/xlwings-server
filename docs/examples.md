# Examples

A good way to get started is to look at the examples:

- Custom functions: [`app/custom_functions/examples.py`](https://github.com/xlwings/xlwings-server/blob/main/app/custom_functions/examples.py)
- Custom scripts: [`app/custom_scripts/examples.py`](https://github.com/xlwings/xlwings-server/blob/main/app/custom_scripts/examples.py). Have a look at [](custom_scripts.md) to see how you can connect them to buttons.
- Task pane examples: [`app/templates/examples`](https://github.com/xlwings/xlwings-server/tree/main/app/templates/examples)

Once you have your own code, you can switch off all the examples via the following setting:

```ini
XLWINGS_ENABLE_EXAMPLES=false
```
