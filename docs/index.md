# xlwings Server

xlwings Server adds Python support to Microsoft Excel without the need of a local Python installation. xlwings Server is self-hosted and runs on any platform that supports Python or Docker, including bare-metal servers, Linux-based VMs, Docker Compose, Kubernetes and serverless products like Azure functions or AWS Lambda. Here are a few highlights:

- Compatible with Python 3.9+
- Compatible with all Excel platforms, including Excel on Windows and macOS, and Excel on the web
- Compatible with all Python packages, including custom ones and those from private registries
- Supports custom scripts and custom functions including streaming functions and object handles
- Allows you to develop modern Office.js add-ins by writing Python code instead of JavaScript
- In addition to Office.js add-ins, you can also use VBA, Office Scripts, and Google Apps Script to talk from Excel to your server. These, however, don't support custom functions.
- Runs in air-gapped environments without Internet access or connection to any Microsoft servers
- Supports SSO (single sign-on) authentication and RBAC (role-based access control) via Microsoft Entra ID (previously known as Azure AD)
- Tight security: uses the HTTP response headers recommended by OWASP
- No sensitive credentials need to be stored on the end-user's computer or in the workbook
- No dependency on Node.js or Webpack even when using Office.js add-ins
- Built with FastAPI, a high-performance, async web framework
- Comes optionally with htmx (client-server interaction), Alpine.js (for client interactions), Socket.io (for streaming functions), and Bootstrap-xlwings (Bootstrap theme in the Excel look)
- xlwings Server is free for non-commercial use
