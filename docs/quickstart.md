# Quickstart

1. Server

- [GitHub Codespaces](github_codespaces.md) is the quickest way to play around with a development environment without having to install anything locally.

2. Client

- TODO

3. Play time:

- Custom scripts: You can click the `Hello World` buttons on the Ribbon and on the task pane. The source code is under `app/custom_scripts/examples.py`.
- Custom functions: In a cell, type: `=XLWINGS.HELLO("world")`. You should see: `Hello world!`. There are a few other (more interesting) examples available that you should see when typing `=XLWINGS.`. The source code is under `app/custom_functions/examples.py`.
